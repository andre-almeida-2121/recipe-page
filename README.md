## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Live Server
- Image preview
- Path Intellisense
- Prettier

### What I learned

I learned more about CSS custom properties, difference between sections and divs in HTML, how to create tables, etc. I must say I'm really happy right now with me, ho much I learned so far.

### Continued development

I intend to use what I learned here in future personal projects, as well as to work with any company.
